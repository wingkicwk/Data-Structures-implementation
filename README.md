# Data-Structures-implementation
This proejct implement the following data structures:
hash table
DFS traversal 
BFS traversal
bubble, quick and merge sort algorithms 
Using Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest distance between two vertices in a weighted graph 
Using Prime’s algorithm to solve minimum spanning tree (MST) problem

Observations are discussed for each of them.
